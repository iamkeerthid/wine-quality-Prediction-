# Wine Quality Analysis

## Submitted by: Keerthi D

### 📌 Objective:
To predict red wine quality using machine learning models based on its physicochemical properties.

### 🧪 Dataset:
- Source: Red wine dataset (XLSX format)
- Features: Fixed acidity, Volatile acidity, Citric acid, Alcohol, etc.
- Target: Quality (score between 3 to 8)

### 🛠 Methods:
- Data Preprocessing (scaling, feature selection)
- Visualization (heatmaps, distribution plots)
- Models Used: Logistic Regression, SVC, XGBoost

### 📊 Results:
- XGBoost achieved the highest accuracy.
- Alcohol and Sulphates were most positively correlated with wine quality.

### 📁 Files Included:
- `Wine_Quality_Analysis.ipynb`: Source notebook
- `Wine_Quality_Report_KeerthiD.docx`: Detailed project report
- `Red_Wine_Dataset.xlsx`: Raw dataset
